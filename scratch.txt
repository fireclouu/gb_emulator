- Display will be handled by SDL
    - per pixel
    - vram starts at 8000H, ends in 9fffH

Plan:
    - fetch d16 (word)
        example: FF 00

    - pixel position are determined by bits, and memory address location
    - color will be determined by high and low significant byte's bit (xs >> pos & 1 [where x = high or low byte])
    - new scanline every vram+0x1f
