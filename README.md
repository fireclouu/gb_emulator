### NOTE!!

I have started my new gameboy emulation journey on [this repository](https://github.com/fireclouu/gb_emulator_2). My goal here is to properly emulate even the most basic program a real gameboy can run, efficiently and with better optimizations.


# GBEMU
This is my gameboy emulator, written in C.
- A rewrite of my first gb emulator that suffers from poor code style and standard.
